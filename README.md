# avatar-modloader
Overrides unpacked assets from the game directory when they exist allowing you to mod the game easily.

### Usage:
- Download the mod from the releases page.
- Extract the files and copy them to the game folder next to `afop.exe`.
- Select "YES" to override `dbgcore.dll`.
- Copy any extracted or modded assets to the game's directory relative to the `afop.exe` and the game will prefer the on-disk copy over the packed one.
